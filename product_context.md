# Product Context: Antigravity Watchdog & Ecosystem

## 🌍 Global Vision

**Antigravity** is an advanced AI coding environment. Our goal is to monetize through a **"Pro Intelligence"** tier that offers superior reliability, analytics, and automation.

## 🤖 Watchdog's Role

The **Antigravity Watchdog** is not just a screenshot tool; it is the **Guardian of Reliability**.

- **Monetization Angle**: It enables the "Premium Reliability" feature. Paid users get automated monitoring that detects quota exhaustion and auto-switches routes or notifies them, preventing downtime.
- **Value Prop**: "Never hit a wall. Antigravity watches your back."

## 💰 Monetization Strategy

- **Free Tier ("Smart Router")**: Zero-config setup, basic routing, community support.
- **Pro Tier ("Pro Intelligence")**:
  - Predictive Quota Tracking (Powered by Watchdog)
  - Advanced Mode-Aware Routing (Sequential Thinking)
  - Persistent History & Analytics (SQLite MCP)
  - Priority Support

## 📣 Marketing Messaging

- **"Zero-Config"**: Frictionless setup is our core competitive advantage.
- **"Invisible Intelligence"**: Tools like Watchdog run silently in the background, fixing problems before the user notices.
- **"Private by Default"**: Local-first preference for models and data.

## 🛠️ Design Principles for Watchdog

1.  **Zero Maintenance**: Must run robustly without user babysitting.
2.  **High Visibility**: When it catches an error, the report must be clear, actionable, and visually distinct (hence the screenshots).
3.  **Low Overhead**: Minimal resource usage while polling.
